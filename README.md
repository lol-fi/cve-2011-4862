# cve-2011-4862

I originally tried to use diff to make a patch.
I patched it the way I thought it would be, before looking
at the real patch.
However, when we tried applying this patch to freeBSD, 
it would not accept it.

Instead, we had to fetch the real patch. I then changed the patch
to implement the fix the way I originally thought it should. 

In the patch, we simply check the length compared to MAXLENGTH.
If it's bigger than that, set it to 0.
This way, it falls into the case of len = 0, which
errors out. This fixes it :-)
